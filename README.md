# Myhra Team Project

This project aims to help team members learn collaborative work through Git, combining individual code contributions and streamlining teamwork.

## Project Design

Design Reference: [Myhra Fluid Template](https://es.squarespace.com/plantillas/myhra-fluid-demo-es)

### Design Features

- **Modern Style**: Clean and contemporary design for a professional look
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptable to different devices (computers, tablets, and mobile phones)
- **User-Friendly**: Intuitive structure for easy navigation and interaction

## Project Structure

### Team Leader Responsibilities

The team leader is responsible for:
- Creating the develop branch
- Setting up initial folder structure (HTML, CSS, IMG)
- Coordinating team workflow

### Branch Structure

We follow the GitFlow branching strategy:
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for all features
- `feature/*` - Individual feature branches

### Individual Branches

- Each team member must create their own branch from `develop`
- Branch naming convention: `feature: <name>` (e.g., `feature: navigation`)

### Workflow Guidelines

1. **Before Pushing**:
   - Always pull from develop to get latest changes
   - Resolve any conflicts locally

2. **File Organization**:
   - Each team member creates their own HTML and CSS files
   - Place files in corresponding folders (HTML, CSS, IMG)

### Commit Conventions

Use the following prefixes for commits:
- `feat: ` for new features (e.g., `feat: add new register button`)
- `fix: ` for bug fixes (e.g., `fix: refactor navigation`)

## Additional Considerations

### Responsive Design
- Each team will implement responsive design if time permits
- Priority should be given to core functionality and integration
- Code quality should be maintained regardless of responsive implementation

### Project Priorities
1. Functionality
2. Code Integration
3. Clean Code
4. Responsive Design (time permitting)
